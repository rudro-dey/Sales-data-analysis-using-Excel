# Sales-data-analysis-using-Excel

The goal of sales data analysis is to uncover valuable information that will help us decide whether to change prices or increase or decrease product supply based on a variety of factors.

If a product's sales are trailing, consider seasonal changes or similar products offered at a lower price by a competitor. It is possible that you will need to reposition products or target a specific customer demographic.

If you conduct a sales study and identify things that aren't selling, that doesn't imply you should get rid of them. It may also advise us to change anything, such as ineffective marketing strategies, in order to increase sales.
